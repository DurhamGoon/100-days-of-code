# Day 1 

### 5/19/2023

I'm starting with the Coursera course and going from there for 60 minutes. (It's Friday) <br>
I went through the course a bit and finished one of the assignments in it. Check it out [here](https://github.com/DurhamGoon/Rando/blob/main/index.html).<br>
It was fun to go over the basics again. Haven't really touched Web Dev since college.<br>
Will probably spend a little more time tomorrow since it's a weekend.
