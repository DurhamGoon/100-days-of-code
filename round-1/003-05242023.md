# Day 4

I'm continuing on the programming assignments for Week 2 of the Algorithmic Toolbox course.<br> The whole purpose of the assignment is to optimize the naive algorithms given to pass all of the restraints given by the Course instructors. <br> I've passed the first one which relates to returning the final Fibonacci number based on inputs. <br>
