# Round 1 

### Day 0 
I will be working on the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals specialization within Coursera to upskill within my current role. I will be starting this course on Coursera: [Programming Foundations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web) as the first course in the specialization.

I may also start on the personal pomodoro app that I want to make. This will primarily be for internal use but I don't mind sharing here.
