# Day 4

I continued to work on the programming assignment and finished the GCD problem. I've implemented a solution for the last fibonacci value problem but can't pass the time constraint for the very large input. <br> Currently working on this and will look implement memoization the next time I work on this. 
<br> I'm contemplating whether I want to save programming assignments for the weekend when I have more time to work on them and leave the learnings to the shorter days. <br> Slow and steady though. I want to be better.
