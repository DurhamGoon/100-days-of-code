# Round 1 Day 0

### 5/18/2023

I will be working on the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals specialization within Coursera to upskill within my current role. I will be starting this course on Coursera: [Programming Foundations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web).
<br><br> I'll also be rotating this with a DSA specialization also on Coursera.
<br>
Update: I've gotten around halfway through the first week of the Course. I've also spent my time doing a little research for a side project I want to do. 
<br>
<br>
The first part of the project is labeling Elon Musks tweets using a Transformer Model. The model I'm interested in testing first is BERT. I'm looking to use this model to create a new variable that tells whether the tweet Elon made had positive, negative or neutral sentiment.  
<br>
No code to add to Git for today.
