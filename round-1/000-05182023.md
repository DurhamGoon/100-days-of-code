# Round 1 Day 0

### 5/18/2023

I will be working on the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals specialization within Coursera to upskill within my current role. I will be starting this course on Coursera: [Programming Foundations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web).
<br><br> I'll also be rotating this with a DSA specialization also on Coursera.
